h1. Vim Plugin for Jasmine javascript testing

This is my first attempt at a vim plugin bundle. I'm sure there are dragons in here. :-)

h2. Installation

I'm currently using Pathogen and am assuming you are too. That means you should be able to do:

bc. git clone git://github.com/claco/jasmine.vim.git bundle/jasmine

inside of your ~/.vim directory. If you're using submodules to track your bundles:

bc. git submodule add git://github.com/claco/jasmine.vim.git bundle/jasmine
git submodule init
git submodule update

h2. What it does

This plugin is pretty basic right now. It currently:

* Sets Spec.js and SpecHelper.js files to jasmine/javascript fileType
* Applies basic syntax highlighting for jasmine keywords in addition to normal javascript syntax
* Loads snippets for jasmine filetype for:
** desc: description block with before..it..expect
** before: beforeEach block
** after: afterEach block
** it: it...expect block
** helper: beforeEach block and matcher for SpecHelper.js
** matcher: matcher block for SpecHelper.js
** expect: expect..to line
** spy: spyOn method

h2. TODO

* Add commands/functions to run a spec, a spec file, and jasmine:ci
* Add Red/Green bar to spec runner output and error buffer support
* docs help file
* autoload/methods/settings
* templates for BufNewFile
